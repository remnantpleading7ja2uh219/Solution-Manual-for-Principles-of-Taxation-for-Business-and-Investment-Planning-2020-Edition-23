  * Principles of Taxation for Business and Investment Planning focuses on the role taxes play in business and investment decision, presenting the general roles of taxation and discussing its implications for all tax-paying entities before delving into a specific exception. The benefit of this approach is a strong grasp of the fundamental principles informing taxation rules: students comprehend the framework of the tax system, making future changes to the tax code easier to understand-no matter how many there are.
 
  * Unlike traditional introductory titles, Principles of Taxation for Business and Investment Planning downplays the technical detail that makes the study of Taxation convoluted and off-putting for business students. This title shows students that an understanding of Taxation is not only relevant, but critical to their success in the business world. Don't just teach your students the tax code; teach them how the tax code affects business decision making with the 2020 edition!
